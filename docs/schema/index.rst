Schema definition
#################


One of the main goals of PyQL is providing a clean way of defining
GraphQL schemas.

In contrast with Graphene, we attempt at providing a cleaner schema
definition API, that also reduces ambiguity and verboseness. We
attempt to use existing facilities in Python as much as possible
(eg. type annotations).
